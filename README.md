# DCrypt
DCrypt (D34d Crypter) is an advanced .NET executable file crypter written in Rust. I created it for educational purposes as part of an academic cybersecurity project, but I decided to edit and support it further after the school project ended. The aim of the project is to apply the latest techniques to avoid detection.
